Compiling KVIrc on macOS

Install Homebrew if you haven’t already. This will also install the Xcode Command Line Tools (llvm/clang, make, etc).
There’s no need to install Xcode from the App Store.

Install CMake and Qt 5 from Homebrew.

    $ brew install cmake

    $ brew install qt5

Download the KVIrc sourcetree with Git and create a build folder as usual. Git was already installed alongside Homebrew.
Run CMake, telling it where Qt is installed:

    $ ccmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/ ..

This folder might change in the future, Homebrew tells you where Qt 5 is going to be installed, so just read its output.

Compile and install:

    $ make install

Creates an .app bundle in the build folder with all necessary dependencies.
To launch it, double click it. To “install” it, drag it to the Applications folder, but this is not necessary.

You can redistribute this bundle to other users and they’ll be able to install it right away. Remember, though, that an .app bundle is actually a folder, so you’ll need to compress it first. Right-clicking it and selecting “Compress” will be enough.
