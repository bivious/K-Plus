## About

Welcome, this is the GitHub development home for the K+ project.

K+ is a experimental fork of the original KVIrc, which is a free and portable IRC client that leverages the Qt GUI toolkit.  
K+ will contain added patches and improvements not submitted upstream.

KVIrc is written by Szymon Stefanek and the KVIrc development team, with the contribution and support of many IRC developers around the world.  

The K+ Team wishes sincere thanks to these hardworking people for their continued contributions.

## Getting Involved

We're actively looking for volunteer K+ developers and community contributors to build a new team.
